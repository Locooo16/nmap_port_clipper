# nmap_port_clipper
Useful tool to clips nmap ports saved in greppable mode to your clipboard to perform a deeper scan afterwards.
Bash script that copies to your clipboard separated by commas all the ports scanned by nmap.
Note: It works when scanning one host at a time since it would be pointless to copy individual ports from various different hosts.
